# Shipping-page
Shipping and payment page using reactJs

## I have created a shipping and Payment reactJs app that displays a form to get user data to deliver the order to the correct person and location and the products that have been shortlisted by the customer with the total cost of the order and also a button to confirm the order and proceed to payment page. I have added styles and created a simple and good looking layout using css which i have included in the react functional components. Many components have been created to serve the purpose of the project and to also improve the readability and understandability of the code. Anyone having a look at our code will be able to understand what has been done and can get an overview of the project quickly
### Content- 
Here, I have created navigation bar at the start with categories(Men, Women,other)and then two buttons have been created for Login and Signup.
I have created a form to get the details of the customer including his/her address to ship the product ordered to the correct address.
The payment methods that are available and the delivery partners associated with the host is also displayed in order.
And at last, the items that are selected shorlisted by the customer for order confirmation are displayed with their image, details and price
Then, the total price of the order is displayed and buttons to proceed for payment and to continue shopping is placed at the bottom of the cart component.
Also, there is a an option created to go to the previous page at the bottom left of the page(back icon with a text:Back).

#### I have used some Functional Components to design the front-end Web page .They are
Navigation, Shipping, Registeration, Payment, Cart. These functional components contain all the content in readable and resuable form for the webpage.
The code can be modified according to the requirements
